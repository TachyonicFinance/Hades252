# Hades252

Implementation of Hades252 over the Ristretto Scalar field.

This is a WIP. No guarantees can be made regarding the API stability.

## Parameters

- p = 2^252 + 27742317777372353535851937790883648493

- Security level is 126 bits

- width = 6

- Number of full rounds = 8 . There are four full rounds at the beginning and four full rounds at the end

- Number of partial rounds = 127, where each partial round has one inversion s-box.

- Number of round constants = 810

## Deviations

- Round constants are generated by first hashing the seed 'hades252_full_rounds', the digest is then mapped onto a scalar in the ristretto scalar field. We then take the byte encoding of the scalar and use it as the seed for the next constant, and so on.

- The MDS matrix is cauchy matrix, the method used to generate it, is noted in section "Concrete Instantiations  Poseidon and Starkad"
